Hi! I am a Master's student in Computer Science and Computer Engineering at the [University of Chile](http://ingenieria.uchile.cl/english), expecting to defend at the end of December (2021). I also have a BSc. in Computer Science Engineering from the same university. My research interests lie at the intersection of game theory and learning. I focus on strategic feedback learning (strategic classification) and bandits applications to market problems. My goal is to make public policy and multi-agent technological systems robust to unfairness caused by strategic agents and information asymmetry.


In my thesis, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Jérémy Barbay](https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~jbarbay/) and [Dr. José Luis Contreras](https://linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-luis-contreras-biekert-01858b1b). After working as a Data Scientist with José on a [study for improving operating rooms](https://www.comisiondeproductividad.cl/estudios/estudios-finalizados-mandatados-por-el-gobierno-de-chile/eficiencia-en-pabellones-y-priorizacion-de-pacientes-para-cirugia-electiva/), I decided to focus my thesis on mechanism design for operating room scheduling. The main result of my thesis is a truthful in expectation approximation mechanism and data from simulations with an untruthful variant of the algorithm.

In 2019 I was a research intern at the [PRIVATICS](https://team.inria.fr/privatics/) team in INRIA Lyon under the supervision of [Mathieu Cunche](https://perso.citi-lab.fr/mcunche/index.html). And co-authored a paper on instance optimal edit distance with Jérémy Barbay, published in [SPIRE 2018](https://link.springer.com/conference/spire). 
  
I also have professional experience as a Software Engineer.
